  <b>Update:</b>

    <ul>
      <br>
      <b>Inventory:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Redesigned the display of stickers on skins and patches on agents. This excludes repeated requests for prices for the same stickers. Also, if you have floats loaded in your inventory, we request prices only from our API, completely excluding requests to Steam</li>
        <li>Clicking on "Select Items" and "Select All" will automatically include and summarize the prices of the SIH Steam provider. But only if all providers have previously been disabled</li>
        <li>"Simplified" / "Compact" inventory display mode will now be enabled by default</li>
        <li>The price provider selection button has been duplicated near the sorts (in the future, the button under the inventory will be removed)</li>
        <li>Using sorting by price will automatically switch on the "SIH Steam" price provider and sort by it. But only if no other price provider is currently enabled</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug where after changing currencies and then trying to select multiple items in your inventory, the total amount was displayed incorrectly</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug where floats were not displayed if all price providers were turned off</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <b>Deal History:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a bug with incorrectly generated item link</li>
        <li>After parsing, the deal history graph data will be saved again and will not be cleared on logout.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <b>Trades page:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Added ability to sort trades by 3 parameters.</li>
        <li>Added possibility to download prices for each trade separately</li>
